    "# Parsing Text Data Patterns Line-by-Line\n",
    "\n",
    "When a text uses natural language, i.e. normal human speech or prose, then data is embedded in\n",
    "the particular syntax and lexicon of that language. Natural Language Processing employs sophisticated\n",
    "models, trained on millions of documents, to parse natural language for meaningful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the Charlotte directory, the text resembles a table with rows and columns, more so than\n",
    "prose. So there are no sentence structures for NLP to use as hints. Instead it reverts to using the English\n",
    "lexicon alone to establish parts of speech and relationships. The result is not much data, in the form of named\n",
    "entity recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the lines in our text file have non-English rules that we can establish and use to extract data directly.\n",
    "For instance, each line starts with a description of the household \"race\" category. Then within households there\n",
    "are often members of another race and these are also labeled. After each mention of race there is usually a surname\n",
    "and then a given name, but not always. Our job is to describe and encode these rules in formal patterns."
